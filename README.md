A flexible Rest Client for Javascript web and native applications

- **Manage the state of your api request globally:**  Kunyora helps you make api calls easily and manage the state of the calls globally especially when integrated with client side libraries like reactJs. It gives you an intuitive way to manage your request using `thenables` and `catchables` to handle success and errors neatly through what we call accessors. 

- **Integratable with Mobile Javascript libraries:** Kunyora works comfortably and is battly tested with Javascript mobile libraries such as React-Native, Ionic Framework or Cordova. It also uses the same api that is used for the web for mobile also without giving error. Now your team has a way to manage api requests comfortably without litering the code base with lots of api calls. 

- **Focused, young and works well with PWA's:** Kunyora also works well with Progressive web apps. The client library integration's to Kunyora also provide ways to minic the typically loading mechnaism used by popular sites such as youtube by establishing an handshake between two pages. 

Kunyora has come to solve a problem we noticed most software developers overlook when building softwares which is the problem of speed. However, the library is currently starting with a pre-release version , and we hope to build this functionality into the major 1.0 release. For now, Kunyora only acts as an api request handler that helps you build UI's without having to plumb your whole codebase with lots of API calls. 

See the official [Kunyora website](https://kunyora.github.io/kunyora) for an introduction to kunyora and an insight on what we are currently achieving and the vision of what we hope to achieve.
